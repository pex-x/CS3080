This essay is concerned with a comparison between the first generation vs. the fifth generation of computers.

The first generation (1946-1959) computers were slow, huge, and expensive. In these computers, vacuum tubes were used as the basic components of CPU and memory.

In the fifth generation (1980-till date) of computers, the VLSI technology was replaced with ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration). It made possible the production of microprocessor chips with ten million electronic components.
